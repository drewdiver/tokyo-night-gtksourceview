# tokyo-night-gtksourceview

[tokyo night colorscheme](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) for gtksourceview5 applications  (gnome text editor, gedit, builder)

this scheme uses the [one made by the dracula team](https://draculatheme.com/gedit) as a base, I just modified the colors 

I've only tested with gnome text editor and there is no light mode option
